This is a submod for Hoi3 BlackIce featuring province photos for provinces that still don't have any, either of strategic importance or with notable landmarks. Most cities (Urban terrain type) already have an unique photo associated with them, however other industrial areas or ports still lack these. The goal is thus to add province photos to all provinces that the player may at some point interact with, usually to perform province upgrades or to check its condition. The majority of photos were taken in the 1930s or in the 1940s however there might be a couple of cases of photos from the 1910s, 1920s or 1950s.

Province priority:

- Industrial zone
- Port/Airbase
- Unique resource
- Famous landmark
